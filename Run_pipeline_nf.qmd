Follow these steps to run [Nextflow](https://www.nextflow.io/) pipelines hosted on GitHub:

Prerequisites

- **Nextflow**: Ensure Nextflow is installed on your system. Follow the [official installation guide](https://www.nextflow.io/docs/latest/getstarted.html#installation).
- **Docker**: Many Nextflow pipelines require Docker. Install Docker by following the [official guide](https://docs.docker.com/get-docker/).

**1. Prepare Your Environment**

Ensure your Nextflow and Docker installations are up to date and correctly configured.

**2. Define the Pipeline Repository**

Define the GitHub repository and its version containing the Nextflow pipeline you wish to run:

```bash
nextflowScript = <Repository_URL>
nextflowScriptVersion = <Repository_Version>'
# Replace <Repository_URL> and <Repository_Version> with the appropriate values for the pipeline you're using.
```

**3. Configure Pipeline Parameters**

Identify the input parameters required by the pipeline. These may include paths to input files, output directories, and other configuration options. Set these parameters using variables:

```bash
input="path/to/input"
outputPath="path/to/output"
# Add more variables as needed
```

**4. Run the Pipeline**

Construct and execute the Nextflow command with your parameters:

```bash
nextflow run  ${nextflowScript} -r ${nextflowScriptVersion} -with-docker --input '${input}' --output '${outputPath}' # Add other parameters as needed
#Replace --input and --output with the appropriate parameter names for your pipeline.
```


**5. Monitor Execution and Check Outputs**

Nextflow will print progress logs to the console. Monitor these logs to ensure the pipeline is executing as expected. Outputs will be saved to the specified output directory.


By following these steps, you can run any Nextflow pipeline hosted on GitHub. Customize the input parameters and execution options based on the specific requirements of the pipeline you're using.
