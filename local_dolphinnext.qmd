**Pull the docker image **


```bash
docker pull ummsbiocore/dolphinnext-studio
```

**Launch the container **


1. To ensure that changes made to the DolphinNext database persist each time the container is launched, we’ll move the database outside of the container. Please select a directory on your local machine for this purpose. For example, in this guide, we’ll use the directory ~/export. To create this directory, use the following command;
```bash
mkdir ~/export
```
2. Running the container;
```bash
docker run --privileged -m 10G -p 8080:80 -v ~/export:/export -ti ummsbiocore/dolphinnext-studio /bin/bash
```
3. After successfully launching the container, you'll need to start the MySQL and Apache servers inside the container using the following command;
```bash
startup
```
4. Now, you can  access DolphinNext through your web browser using the following URL;
[http://localhost:8080/dolphinnext](http://localhost:8080/dolphinnext)
